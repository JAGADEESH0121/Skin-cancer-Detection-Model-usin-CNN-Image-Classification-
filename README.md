Developed a binary image classifier for skin lesion detection (benign vs. malignant). – Used 10,000 labeled dermoscopic images from Kaggle resembling ISIC/HAM10000 datasets. – Preprocessed data using resizing (224x224), normalization, label encoding, and augmentation. – Used EfficientNetB0 with transfer learning and custom dense layers (ReLU, Softmax). – Trained the model using Adam optimizer over 50 epochs; binary cross-entropy loss. – Achieved 99% training and 93% validation accuracy; evaluated using F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc. – Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
